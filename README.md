## Synopsis

Build a Camper Leaderboard. This is a project for Free Code Camp's Data Visualization Certification.

## More Info

**User Story**: I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

**User Story**: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

**User Story**: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total. (top campers of all time)

Hint: To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: [https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent](https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent)
